# Maryo
### A different version of maryo based on python.
This is the game that I developed using python. It has 4 levels, with increasing difficulty. Duh!

The sprites, sounds and images used in the game are stored in 'FP sampls' folder.

## Requirements!

  - Python
  - Python's pygame library

## Installation

Maryo requires Python and pygame to run.

Type the following commands before running the main file. If you already have python installed, you can skip the first command.

```sh
$ pip install python
$ npm install pygame
```
## Running
Now to run the game, type the following commands.
```sh
$ cd FP/ sampls
$ python maryo.py
```
Enjoy!!

Suggestions are welcome.
